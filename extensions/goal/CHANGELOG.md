# @zhushanwen/pi-goal

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- 2a3fed0: Introduce `pending-notifications` extension and wire workflow/subagent background operations into it.

  - New `pending-notifications` extension tracks active async operations (workflow/subagent) via EventBus + session entries.
  - Workflow `run` / `abort` / terminal error paths emit `pending:register` and `pending:unregister` through a single EventBus port.
  - Subagent background mode now emits the same events via `pi.events.emit`; stale-context errors during subagent child sessions are now tolerated.
  - Goal's `before_agent_start` reads pending entries and injects a waiting hint when async work is active.
  - Added `workflow:log`, `pending:log`, and `goal:log` debug entries for tracing the register/unregister flow.
  - Workflow UI rendering improvements: themed border helpers and fixed overlay ghost rows.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- b868113: Architecture rewrite + Codex-parity behavior model for `@zhushanwen/pi-goal`.

  **Round 1 — 6-layer ports/adapters architecture:**

  - Layered split: `engine/` (zero Pi deps, pure state machines) → `ports.ts`
    (machine-checkable boundary) → `service.ts` (dual entry) → `adapters/` →
    `projection/` → `index.ts` (thin factory)
  - Deleted 9 legacy god-files (state/budget/widget/templates/tool-handler/
    action-handlers/command-handler/agent-end-handler/before-agent-start-handler)
  - Engine never imports `@mariozechner/*`; budget decisions and persistence are
    pure and independently tested
  - FR-5: strict serialize/deserialize (no legacy format compat — clean break)
  - FR-6.2: token/time budget warning flags are independent (4 flags)
  - FR-6.5: time accumulation extracted to a pure `tick()` (no double-write)
  - FR-6.7: ESC is a pure interrupt via `ctx.signal.aborted`; removed
    `pendingPause` field and module-level `lastCtx`

  **Round 2 — Codex-parity behavior model (FR-1…FR-7):**

  - FR-1: goal reuses `pi-todo` as its task model. `pi-todo` upgraded to a
    four-state model (`pending`/`in_progress`/`completed`/`cancelled`) with an
    optional `isVerification` flag and legacy migration
  - FR-2: new lightweight `goal_control` tool (`create`/`complete`/
    `report_blocked`); `goal_manager` task CRUD retired
  - FR-3: **7-state goal machine** per ADR-002
    (`active | paused | blocked | complete | budget_limited | time_limited |
cancelled`). Pi adds `time_limited` + `cancelled` vs Codex and deliberately
    omits `usage_limited` (Extension model doesn't own session-level quotas).
    `paused` is retained — `/goal pause` + `/goal resume` (recovers
    `paused|blocked → active`) work as before
  - FR-4: staleness reminder via `lastUpdatedTurn`; `agent_end` is warning-only
    with a single budget checkpoint
  - FR-5: budget auto-trigger on the event path (`persistAndUpdate` fallback,
    fires only for `active`)
  - FR-6: prompt-driven completion audit — `complete` is a soft suggestion, not
    a hard tool action; prerequisites enforced
  - FR-7: plan↔goal automatic linkage; goal↔todo dependency is `optional`
    (degrades gracefully when todo is missing)

  `pi-coding-workflow` / `pi-plan` receive a patch: their inline `GoalInitFn`
  type alias is updated to mirror goal's new required-`ctx` signature (no runtime
  change; callers already pass `ctx`).

  See `docs/adr/002-goal-7-state-machine.md` for the 7-state rationale.
